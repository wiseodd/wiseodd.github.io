This year (2024), I did the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges/games.
It's essentially a daily programming puzzle challenge, spanning over the advent period (December 1 - 25).[^1]
Since I have extensively learned [Rust](https://github.com/wiseodd/rustlox) and [Zig](https://github.com/wiseodd/rustlox) early on in the year, and since I write [Python](https://github.com/wiseodd) professionally, I decided to use something new for this.

Because of Rust, I became to like the [ML family of languages](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)>) (think of OCaml, not machine learning).
My choice landed upon [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), a functional language that is quite similar in look-and-feel as Rust.
Programming in Gleam does feel like programming in Rust but in a strict, functional way:
There's no escape hatch to fall back to procedural programming with mutability.

This post is a "great-bad" (👍-👎) evaluation of Gleam for solving programming puzzles.
At the end, I will also give my opinion on what Gleam is currently lacking from the perspective of a machine learning scientist.

## 👍 I wish every language had a pipeline operator

Suppose we have $n$ functions $(f_i: \mathcal{X}_{i-1} \to \mathcal{X}_{i})_{i=1}^n$ where each function $f_i$ has domain the previous function's codomain.
Suppose $x \in \mathcal{X}_0$ is the initial input and we would like to apply this sequence of functions to obtain $y \in \mathcal{X}_n$.
There are two ways of doing this:

- compose the functions, then apply $x$: $(f_n \cdot \dots \cdot f_1)(x)$, or
- apply the function to the previous function's output: $f_n(f_{n-1}(\dots f_1(x)))$.

Back to the programming world, usually we do the latter and we do so by calling `f_n(f_n_1(... f_1(x)))`.
But it can be cumbersome to match the parens.
Even more so if $n$ is large.

In Gleam (and other functional languages), there is a special operator called the _pipeline operator_ `|>`.
The above example can then be written as `x |> f_1 |> f_2 |> ... |> f_n`.
Neat!

Here's an example from my [AoC 2024 solutions](https://github.com/wiseodd/aoc-2024) code:

```gleam
let result =
    x
    |> string.trim
    |> string.split(": ")
    |> list.last
    |> result.unwrap("")
    |> string.split(",")

// Compare to: (!!)
let result = string.split(result.unwrap(list.last(string.split(string.trim(x), ": ")), ""), ",")
```

As we can see, the pipeline operator is a very nice way to "carry" an input through the "pipeline" to obtain the result at the opposite end.

Traditionally the pipeline operator will put the output of the previous function to the first input of the next function.
However, in Gleam, we can put an output into an arbitrary input slot of the next function:

```gleam
fn f(first: String, second: Int, third: Float) {
  ...
}

let x: Int = 5
x |> f("first", _, 7.22)
```

That is, `_` marks the "slot" we want to put the l.h.s. of the pipeline operator into.

## 👍 The "let assert" keyword is great for rapid prototyping

When writing a Rust code, I often do so in multiple passes.
First, a prototyping phase where I use the `.unwrap()` and `if-let-else-panic` snippets extensively to validate my algorithms quickly without worrying about safety.
Then, the second phase is to refactor the above carefully, and handle all cases/errors correclty instead of throwing panic everyime.

However, in programming challenges like AoC, we don't really need to robustly handle error --- all that matters is correctness.
So it's useful to just stop after the first phase.

How can we do this in Gleam?
For sure we don't really want to handle all pattern matching cases exhaustively for AoC.
For instance, if we know the input for the puzzle is a file with two text blocks separated by an empty line, we process this input by:

```gleam
import simplifile

fn parse() {
  case simplifile.read("data/day25_input.txt") {
    Ok(content) -> {
      case content |> string.trim |> string.split("\n\n") {
        [first_block, second_block] -> ...
        _ -> ...
      }
    }
    Error(_) -> ...
  }
}
```

For the sake of robustness, the code will be quite long and nested.
Thankfully, Gleam has a special keyword `let assert` to alleviate this.
Think of it as `.unwrap()` and `if-let-else-panic` in Rust:
If something doesn't match the asserted pattern, it will immediately panic.

So, the code above can be written as:

```gleam
import simplifile

fn parse() {
  let assert Ok(content) = simplifile.read("data/day25_input.txt")
  let assert [first_block, second_block] = content |> string.trim |> string.split("\n\n")
  ...
}
```

Much more concise!

## 👍 The "use" expression is a godsend

I wrote about Gleam's `use` expression in the [previous post](/blog/gleam-use), where I approached the discussion from Python's `with`-block perspective.
However, it can also be combined with the stdlib functions `bool.guard` and `bool.lazy_guard` to emulate early returns in procedural languages and to easily emulate Python's decorator.

### Emulating early return

In Rust, we can do:

```rust
fn my_function(x: i32) -> bool {
  if x > 5 {
    return false;
  }

  let y = x + 3;
  let z = y * 3;
  z == 11
}

fn my_function_alt(x: i32) -> bool {
  if x > 5 {
    return false;
  } else {
    let y = x + 3;
    let z = y * 3;
    return z == 11;
  }
}
```

Notice that the first function is cleaner.
This will be even more apparent if inside the `else` block we have a very long code.

The standard functional counterpart would be:

```gleam
fn my_function(x: Int) -> Bool {
  case x {
    _ if x > 5 -> False
    _ -> {
      let y = y + 3
      let z = y * 3
      z == 11
    }
  }
}
```

Imagine if we have nested `if`'s.
The nestings, indentations, and curly brackets in the above Gleam code will make the code quite ugly and hard to debug.
Luckily, the `use` expression, combined with `bool.guard` can rescue us:

```gleam
import gleam/bool

fn my_function(x: Int) -> Bool {
  use <- bool.guard(x > 5, False)
  let y = y + 3
  let z = y * 3
  z == 11
}
```

Notice that we have no nesting now!
To drive home the point, consider this nested-if code:

```gleam
fn my_function(x: Int) -> Bool {
  case x {
    _ if x > 5 -> False
    _ -> {
      let y = y + 3
      case y {
        4 -> False
        _ -> {
          let z = y * 3
          case z {
            _ if z % 2 == 0 -> True
            _ -> z == 11
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I'm already tired just looking at that code 😩.
With `use` and `bool.guard` we can achieve a cleaner look:

```gleam
import gleam/bool

fn my_function(x: Int) -> Bool {
  use <- bool.guard(x > 5, False)

  let y = y + 3
  use <- bool.guard(y == 4, False)

  let z = y * 3
  use <- bool.guard(z % 2 == 0, True)

  z == 11
}
```

No indentation, no nesting 🥳!

As a final note, be attentive to the return value of your early return.
If the return value is a result of a dynamic computation, `bool.lazy_guard` should be used instead.
The difference is that the second argument (previously, the return value e.g. `False`) is now a callback function that will be executed lazily when the first argument evaluates to `True`.

### Emulating Python decorator

Since AoC is a programming puzzle, dynamic programming (DP) questions often come up.
In functional language, it's natural to write a top-down DP since it amounts to recursion and memoization.
However, memoization is cumbersome in functional language due to immutability.
For example, in Python, we can do:

```python
memo: Dict[int, int] = {}

def main():
    ns: List(int) = [1, 2, 59, 10]
    fibs: List(int) = [fibo(n) for n in ns]

def fibo_explicit(n: int) -> int:
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]

    if n <= 1:
        return n

    res = fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2)
    memo[n] = res

    return res

import functools

@functools.cache
def fibo_cache(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    return fibo_cache(n - 1) + fibo_cache(n - 2)
```

As we can see, we can have a clean code by defining `memo` as a global, mutable variable.
Moreover, this can be simplified further by using `functools.cache` decorator: We write the standard, non-memoized version, and just slap `@functools.cache` on top.
But in Gleam, we have to do this:

```gleam
import gleam/dict.{type Dict}
import gleam/pair

fn main() {
  let memo: Dict(Int, Int) = dict.new()
  let ns: List(Int) = [1, 2, 59, 10]

  let fibs: List(Int) = ns |> list.map_fold(memo, fn(memo, n) {
    let #(res, memo) = fibo(n, memo)
    #(memo, res)
  })
  |> pair.second
}

fn fibo(n: Int, memo: Dict(Int, Int)) -> #(Int, Dict(Int, Int)) {
  use <- bool.lazy_guard(memo |> dict.has_key(n), fn() { memo |> dict.get(n) |> result.unwrap(0) })
  use <- bool.guard(n <= 1, n)

  let #(res, memo) = fibo(n - 1, memo) + fibo(n - 2, memo)
  let memo = memo |> dict.insert(n, res)

  #(res, memo)
}
```

We use `list.map_fold` since we have to keep track of the state of `memo` and reuse it for the next function calls of `fibo`.
It has quite a bit of boilerplate and we must return `memo` together with the result in the `fibo` function.
The result is a longer and less clean code.

Thankfully, the `use` expression enables us to emulate Python's decorator, which `@functools.cache` is.
Someone has thought of this and it's available here, as a [`rememo` library](https://github.com/hunkyjimpjorps/rememo).
Then we can write this cleaner code:

```gleam
import gleam/dict.{type Dict}
import rememo/memo

fn main() {
  let ns: List(Int) = [1, 2, 59, 10]

  use cache <- memo.create()

  let fibs: List(Int) = ns |> list.map(fn(n) {
    fibo(n, cache)
  })
}

fn fibo_cache(n: Int, cache) -> Int {
  use <- memo.memoize(cache, n)
  use <- bool.guard(n <= 1, n)
  fibo_cache(n - 1, cache) + fibo_cache(n - 2, cache)
}
```

Looks great 🤩🤩🤩!!!

## 👎 No operator overloading

Suppose I have an integer `x` and a float `y` and I want to add them together.
In most contemporary languages, you can just write `x + y`.
But this cannot be done in Gleam since integer addition and float addition are two different operators: `+` and `+.`, respectively.
There is a good reason for this, just like in [OCaml](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64244351/why-does-ocaml-have-mandatory-distinct-float-and-int-literal-syntax).
But the end result is a more verbose, out-of-the-ordinary (and thus perceived as unnatural) code:

```gleam
let x: Int = 5
let y: Float = 10.0

// Error!
let res: Float = x + y

// Ok!
import gleam/int
let res: Float = int.to_float(x) +. y
```

I could imagine that due to this, you cannot have a concise expression like `tensor_1 + tensor_2` for some `ndarray` types defined in a hypothetical Gleam tensor library.

All in all, I don't think this will help Gleam if it wants to be widely adopted by people from various scientific communities.

## 👎 Barebone ecosystem

On [Day 13 of AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13), the puzzle can be solved by solving a system of linear equations.
In Python, there is Numpy, PyTorch, etc., giving rise to a concise solution:

```python
A = ...
b = ...
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)  # or, np.linalg.inv(A) @ b
```

But what about Gleam?
I don't see any robust, full-featured ndarray/tensor library in Gleam.
OCaml has [`owl`](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl), Elixir has [`nx`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx), Gleam has none.
Not only that, `pandas`-like and `matplotlib`-like libraries are also missing.

From what I've gathered, Gleam is fully interoperable with other languages in the Erlang virtual machine.
This means Gleam can actually call Elixir libraries such as `nx` for ndarrays, [`explorer`](https://github.com/elixir-explorer/explorer) for dataframes, and [`VegaLite`](https://github.com/livebook-dev/vega_lite) for plotting.
However, it seems one needs to explicitly "translate" every Elixir function into Gleam first before using it.
For example: [^2]

```gleam
@external(erlang, "Elixir.BasicProject", "hello")
fn hello_elixir() -> Thing
```

I can then call `hello_elixir()` in my `.gleam` file and it will, in turn, call the specified Elixir code.
It would be great if we could just call Elixir code without translating it first: Just add Elixir dependencies, then call.
Or, better yet, we need Gleam bindings for all those aforementioned libraries.
Without this, I don't think Gleam can sway Python's ML or data science community.

## Conclusion

Gleam is great and is a breath of fresh air coming from Python!
I wish I could just use Gleam for all my research work but alas.

Actually, after writing this post, I became even more intrigued with Elixir.
It might scratch my itch of moving away from Python due to less "quirky" design decisions and due to its more mature, vibrant scientific computing ecosystem.
It's a shame that I can't move to Gleam (just yet, hopefully), though.
