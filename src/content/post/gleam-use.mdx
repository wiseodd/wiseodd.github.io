Everybody who knows Python has used the `with` statement, most commonly when opening
a file.[^1]
It's quite powerful!

Gleam is a radically different type of language from Python.
It can be seen as a purely functional version of Rust.
We know that things are rather less obvious in purely functional languages.
So the question here is, how can we emulate the behavior of Python's `with` statement?
Another question is (due to the similarity of Rust and Gleam), how to emulate
Rust's `?` syntax in Gleam?

## 'use' For Emulating the 'with' Statement in Python

In Python, this code

```python title="Python"
f = open("filename.txt")
ret = do_something_with_file(f)
f.close()
```

can be rewritten with the `with` statement, resulting in a nice, less verbose
piece of code:

```python title="Python"
with open("filename.txt") as f:
    ret = do_something_with_file(f)
```

Conceptually, the `with` statement can be thought of as a higher-order function
(a function that takes other functions) with a callback function as its last parameter.
The block inside the statement (`ret = ...` above) is the body of the callback function.
In code, this is:

```python title="Python"
def file_action(filename: str, callback: Callable[[File], Any]):
    f = open(filename)
    ret = callback(f)
    f.close()
    return ret

ret = file_action("filename.txt", do_something_with_file)
```

Assuming the functions `open`, `close` are available and behaving similarly to the
above, we can rewrite it one-to-one in Gleam.
(The type `rtype` below is a generic type.)

```gleam title="Gleam"
fn file_action(filename: String, callback: fn(File) -> rtype) -> rtype {
  let f: File = open(filename)
  let ret: rtype = callback(f)
  close(filename)
  ret
}
```

What is the Gleam equivalent to the same code, written with the `with`
statement then?
It is this:

```gleam title="Gleam"
use f <- file_action("filename.txt")
let ret: rtype = do_something_with_file(f)
```

We can think of the first line `use retval <- func(args)` as the direct counterpart
of `with func(args) as retval`.
Note that _all_ code under `use .. <- ..` will be included in the body of `callback`.[^2]
If this is an undesirable behavior, we can make the scope similar
to Python's by simply doing:
(Note that in Gleam, everything is an expression!)

```gleam title="Gleam"
let ret: rtype = {
  use f <- file_action("filename.txt")
  do_something_with_file(f)
}

// Outside of the scope
do_something_else(ret)
```

## 'use' For Emulating '?' in Rust

Gleam is like a functional (garbage-collected) variant of Rust---they have many
similarities.
One of them is this: errors in Gleam and Rust are _return values_.
So, there is no `throw-try-catch` as in Python or C-inspired languages.

The usual way we handle errors in Rust is by returning the type
`Result<return_type, error_type>`.
Then, if we don't want to do error handling in a function that calls a function
with the `Result` type as the return value, we can simply return that error
when it occurs.
In code, this is:

```rust title="Rust"
fn do_something_and_return_string() -> Result<String, Err> {
  // ...
}

fn process_the_retval() -> Result<(), Err> {
  match do_something_and_return_string() {
    Ok(ret_val) -> // do something with the string ret_val
    Err(err_val) -> Err(err_val) // just propagate the err
  }
}
```

Notice that we must do the pattern matching `match` to handle the `Result` type.
Notice also that if we don't want to handle the error here, we have that line
`Err(err_val) -> Err(err_val)` which is quite verbose.

In Rust, this can be concisely rewritten with `?`:[^3]

```rust title="Rust"
fn process_the_retval() -> Result<(), Err> {
  let ret_val: String = do_something_and_return_string()?;
  // do something with the string ret_val
}
```

Gleam also has the `Result` type and `use` can be used to do the same
thing as in Rust.

```gleam title="Gleam"
fn process_the_retval() -> Result(Nil, Err) {
  case do_something_and_return_string() {
    Ok(ret_val) -> // do something with the string ret_val
    Error(err_val) -> Error(err_val)
  }
}
```

In Gleam, we can use `result.map`
to circumvent the need for pattern matching.[^4]

```gleam title="Gleam"
fn callback(s: String) {
  // do something with the string ret_val
}

fn process_the_retval() -> Result(Nil, Err) {
  result.map(do_something_and_return_string(), callback)
}
```

But this is just the higher-order function pattern that we have seen before
in the previous section.
So, we can rewrite it more concisely with `use`:

```gleam title="Gleam"
fn process_the_retval() -> Result(Nil, Err) {
  use ret_val <- result.map(do_something_and_return_string())
  // do something with the string ret_val
}
```

Notice the similarity as the Rust code with `?`!
