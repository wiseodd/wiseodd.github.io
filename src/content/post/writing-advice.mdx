## General protips

- **DO:** Write before you even do any experiment.
- **_DONâ€™T_:** Leave everything to the last minute, esp. writing.
- **DO:** _Obsess_ over styling (see below).
- **DO:** Read _widely_ and _a lot_ (in English!): novels, nonfictions,
  popular science, etc.
- **DO:** Read math books and appreciate the typography & styling.

## LaTeX protips

- **One line = one sentence**
  - This will make debugging easier, due to how LaTeX shows errors
- **Quotation marks:** Instead of `"something"`, write ` ``something'' `
  (2 backtics & 2 standard ticks)
- **Math macros:** Use this and add your own often-used math definitions
  https://github.com/goodfeli/dlbook_notation/blob/master/math_commands.tex
  - So, gone are the days where you need to write `\mathbf{x}` again and again.
    Instead you could just write `\vx`.
- **Citation:** Always use `natbib`! Two ways of citing:
  - "... has been done before [4]." --- in this case, you use `\citep`
    and write `... has been done before \citep{someone2024}`.
  - "Someone et al, 2024 has done ..." --- in this case, you use `\citet`
    and write `\citet{someone2024} has done ...`
- **Table:** Always use booktabs instead of standard table.

- **Style tips:**
  - Figures must always fill the full paper width (or column width).
    - Use my library: https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots
    - https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-figure-with-multiple-subplots
  - Tables, likewise, must also always fill the full width.

  - If you think they are not appropriate for full width, use wrapfig and wraptable:

- **Bibliography:**
  - Don't just copy-paste from Google Scholar! Always recheck & edit!
  - E.g. make sure the proper capitalization:
    - Instead of: `title={Introduction to Bayesian optimization}`
    - Write this: `title={Introduction to {B}ayesian optimization}`
    - I.e., always surround the character that needs to be capitalized
      with `{ }`
  - Venue precedence if a publication appears in multiple venues
    (top = most prioritized):
    1. Journal
    2. Conference
    3. Workshop/symposium
    4. ArXiv/preprint
