## General writing protips

- **DO:** Write before you even do any experiment.
  - Your initial draft = hypothesis
  - Experiments = observations
  - Update your draft based on your experiments = posterior
  - Rinse lather repeat
- **_DONâ€™T_:** Leave everything to the last minute, esp. writing.
- **_DON'T_:** Wait until the last minute to submit your paper.
  - Server overload is a thing.
- **DO:** Read _widely_ and _a lot_ (in English!): novels, nonfictions,
  popular science, etc.
- **DO:** Take pride of your work and paper. It's your life's work.
  - Haphazard, low-effort, inconsistent-styling paper signals to the reader that you
    yourself don't care.
  - Why should they care about your work then?
- **DO:** See paper-writing as a **_craft_**. Always hone your **_craftmanship_**.
- **DO:** _Obsess_ over styling (see below).
- **DO:** Read math books and appreciate the typography & styling.
- **DO:** Have a blog site. Publish several in-depth blog posts per year.
- **_DON'T:_** Be afraid of people think you're dumb based on your blog posts.
  - See my blog post archive from 2016 --- they're so simple and embarassing.

## LaTeX protips

### General

- **One line = one sentence**
  - This will make debugging easier, due to how LaTeX shows errors
- **Quotation marks:** Instead of `"something"`, write ` ``something'' `
  (2 backtics & 2 standard ticks)

### Styles

#### Figures

- Must always fill the full paper width (or column width).
  - Use [my library](https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots).
  - For figures with multiple subplots, avoid creating a single pdf file
    for each subplot. Instead, [follow this](https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-figure-with-multiple-subplots)
- If you think they are not appropriate for full width, use [wrapfig](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Positioning_images_and_tables).
  - See also [how to do this with my plotting library](https://github.com/wiseodd/pub-ready-plots?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-plots-for-wrapfigure).

#### Tables

- Always use booktabs instead of standard table. [See this](https://nhigham.com/2019/11/19/better-latex-tables-with-booktabs/).
- Like figures, must also always fill the full width.
  [See how](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/240154/setting-table-width-exactly-to-linewidth).
- Also, like figures, use [wraptable](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Positioning_images_and_tables)
  if your table is not appropriate for full width.

### Maths

- **Math macros:** [Use this](https://github.com/goodfeli/dlbook_notation/blob/master/math_commands.tex)
  and add your own often-used math definitions
  - So, gone are the days where you need to write `\mathbf{x}` again and again.
    Instead you could just write `\vx`.

### Bibliography

#### Citations

- Always use `natbib`! Two ways of citing:
  - "... has been done before [4]." --- in this case, you use `\citep`
    and write `... has been done before \citep{someone2024}`.
  - "Someone et al, 2024 has done ..." --- in this case, you use `\citet`
    and write `\citet{someone2024} has done ...`

#### References / bibtex

- **Rule to live by:** Dirty, inconsistent, low-effort reference list signals
  to the reader that you don't care. Why should they care about your work?
- Don't just copy-paste from Google Scholar! Always recheck & edit!
- E.g. make sure the proper capitalization:
  - Instead of: `title={Introduction to Bayesian optimization}`
  - Write this: `title={Introduction to {B}ayesian optimization}`
  - I.e., always surround the character that needs to be capitalized
    with `{ }`
- Venue precedence if a publication appears in multiple venues
  (top = most prioritized):
  1. Journal
  2. Conference
  3. Workshop/symposium
  4. ArXiv/preprint
- For well-known ML conferences, simply use their abbreviations.
  - E.g. "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35" -> "NeurIPS".
- For conference, use `@inproceedings`.
  - The only fields needed are `title`, `author`, `booktitle`, and `year`.
  - No need for other things like `page`, `editor`, etc.
- For journal/ArXiv, use `@article`.
  - Use `journal` instead of `booktitle`.
  - Additionally, `volume` and `number` must be included.
- **Example:**

```bibtex
@inproceedings{kristiadi2024sober,
  title={
    A Sober Look at {LLMs} for Material Discovery:
    {A}re They Actually Good for {B}ayesian Optimization Over Molecules?
  },
  author={
    Kristiadi, Agustinus and Strieth-Kalthoff, Felix and Skreta, Marta
    and Poupart, Pascal and Aspuru-Guzik, Al\'{a}n and Pleiss, Geoff
  },
  booktitle={ICML},
  year={2024}
}
```
