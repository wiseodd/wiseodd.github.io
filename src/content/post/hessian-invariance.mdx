Let $f: \mathcal{X} \times \Theta \to \R^k$ be a neural network, defined by $(x, \theta) \mapsto f(x; \theta) = f_\theta(x)$.
Suppose $\L: \Theta \to \R$ is a loss function defined on the $d$-dimensional parameter space $\Theta$ of $f$ and let $\theta^*$ be a minimum of $\L$.
Suppose further $\varphi: \Theta \to \Psi$ is a **_reparametrization_**, i.e., a differentiable map with a differentiable inverse, mapping $\theta \mapsto \psi$.

Suppose we transform $\theta^*$ into $\psi^* = \varphi(\theta^*)$.
The consensus in the deep learning field regarding the Hessian matrix $H(\theta^*)$ of $\L$ at $\theta^*$ is that:

1. The _eigenvalues_ of $H(\theta^*)$ are not invariant.
2. The _determinant_ of $H(\theta^*)$ is not invariant.
3. The _trace_ of $H(\theta^*)$ is not invariant.
4. Seen as a _bilinear map_, the Hessian is not invariant outside the critical points of $\L$.

In this post, we shall see that these quantities are actually invariant under reparametrization!
Although the argument comes from Riemannian geometry, it will also hold even if we use the default assumption found in calculus---the standard setting assumed by deep learning algorithms and practitioners.

**Note.**
Throughout this post, we use the Einstein summation convention.
That is, we sum two variables together if one has an upper index and the other has a lower index, while omitting the summation symbol.
For example: $v^i w_i$ corresponds to $\sum_i v^i w_i$ and $v^i w^j H_{ij} = \sum_i \sum_j v^i w^j H_{ij}$, meanwhile the index $i$ in the following partial derivative $\partial f/\partial \theta^i$ counts as a lower index.

## The Hessian as a Bilinear Map

In calculus, the Hessian matrix $H(\theta^*)$ at $\theta^*$ is defined by

$$
  H_{ij}(\theta^*) = \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^i \theta^j}(\theta^*) \qquad\qquad \text{for all} \qquad i,j = 1, \dots, d .
$$

The Hessian matrix defines a bilinear function, i.e., given arbitrary vectors $v, w$ in $\R^d$, we can write a function $B(v, w) = v^i w^j H_{ij}(\theta^*)$.
For example, this term comes up in the 2nd-order Taylor expansion of $\L$ at $\theta^*$:

$$
\begin{align}
  \L(\theta) &\approx \L(\theta^*) + (\nabla \L \vert_{\theta^*})^\top d + \frac{1}{2} \underbrace{d^\top H(\theta^*) d}_{=B(d, d)} ,
\end{align}
$$

where we have defined $d = (\theta - \theta^*)$.

Under the reparametrization $\varphi: \theta \mapsto \psi$ with $\psi^* = \varphi(\theta^*)$, we have $\L \mapsto \varphi^{-1}$.
Thus, by the chain and product rules, the Hessian $H_{ij}$ becomes

$$
\begin{align}
  \tilde{H}_{ij} &= \frac{\partial^2 (\L \circ \varphi^{-1})}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \psi^j}\left( \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^m} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \right) \\
    &= \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} + \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} .
\end{align}
$$

However, notice that if we evaluate $\tilde{H}_{ij}$ at a minimum $\psi^* = \varphi(\theta^*)$, the second term vanishes.
And so, we have

$$
  \tilde{H}_{ij}(\psi^*) = \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n}(\varphi^{-1}(\psi^*)) \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i}(\psi^*) \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j}(\psi^*) .
$$

Meanwhile, if $v = (v^1, \dots, v^d)$ and $w = (w^1, \dots, w^d)$ are vectors at $\theta^* \in \Theta$, their components become

$$
  \tilde{v}^i = v^m \frac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial \theta^m}(\theta^*) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \tilde{w}^j = w^n \frac{\partial \psi^j}{\partial \theta^n}(\theta^*) ,
$$

because the Jacobian of the reparametrization (i.e. change of coordinates) $\varphi: \theta \mapsto \psi$ defines a change of basis.

Notice that $\frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i}(\psi^*)$ is the inverse of $\frac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial \theta^m}(\theta^*) = \frac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial \theta^m}(\varphi^{-1}(\psi^*))$.
Considering the transformed $H$, $v$, and $w$, the bilinear map $B$ then becomes

$$
\begin{align}
  \tilde{B}(\tilde{v}, \tilde{w}) &= \tilde{v}^i \tilde{w}^j \tilde{H}_{ij}(\psi^*) \\
    %
    &= v^m \cancel{\frac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial \theta^m}(\varphi^{-1}(\theta^*))} w^n \cancel{\frac{\partial \psi^j}{\partial \theta^n}(\varphi^{-1}(\theta^*))} \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n}(\varphi^{-1}(\psi^*)) \cancel{\frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i}(\psi^*)} \cancel{\frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j}(\psi^*)} \\
    %
    &= v^m w^n H_{mn}(\varphi^{-1}(\psi^*)) .
\end{align}
$$

under the reparametization $\varphi$.
Since all those indices $m$, $n$ are simply dummy indices, the last expression is equivalent to $v^i w^i H_{ij}(\theta^*)$.
Since $v$ and $w$ and $\varphi$ are arbitrary, this implies that, seen as a bilinear map, the Hessian at a minimum $\theta^*$ is _invariant_ under reparametrization.

## The Non-Invariance of the Hessian

While the Hessian, as a bilinear map at a minimum, is (functionally) invariant, some of its downstream quantities are not.
Let us illustrate this using the determinant---one can also easily show similar results for trace and eigenvalues.

First, recall that the components $H_{ij}(\theta^*)$ of the Hessian transforms into the following under a reparametrization $\varphi$:

$$
  \tilde{H}_{ij}(\psi^*) = \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n}(\varphi^{-1}(\psi^*)) \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i}(\psi^*) \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j}(\psi^*) .
$$

In matrix notation, this is $\tilde{\mathbf{H}} = (\mathbf{J}^{-1})^\top \mathbf{H} \mathbf{J}^{-1}$.
(The dependency on $\psi^*$ is omitted for simplicity.)
Then, the determinant of $\tilde{\mathbf{H}}$ is

$$
  \det \tilde{\mathbf{H}} = (\det \mathbf{J}^{-1})^2 \det \mathbf{H} .
$$

Thus, in general, $\det \tilde{\mathbf{H}} \neq \det \mathbf{H}$.
Hence the determinant of the Hessian is not invariant.
This causes problems in deep learning:
For instance, [Dinh et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04933) argue that one cannot study the connection between flatness and generalization performance at the minimum of $\L$.

## The Riemannian Hessian

From the Riemannian-geometric perspective, the component $H_{ij}$ of the Hessian of $\L$ is defined under $\theta$ coordinates/parametrization as:

$$
  H_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^i \partial \theta^j} - \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^k} ,
$$

where $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ is a three-dimensional array that represent the [Levi-Civita connection (or any connection)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection) on the tangent spaces of $\Theta$, seen as a Riemannian manifold.
In the calculus case, where the Euclidean metric and the Cartesian coordinates are assumed by default, $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ vanishes identically; hence the previous definition of the Hessian.
This also shows that the Riemannian Hessian is a generalization to the standard Hessian.

Under a reparametrization $\varphi: \theta \to \psi$, the _connection coefficient_ $\Gamma$ [transforms as follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols#Transformation_law_under_change_of_variable):

$$
  \tilde\Gamma_{ij}^k = \Gamma_{mn}^o \frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} + \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} \frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o} .
$$

And thus, combined with the transformation of the "calculus Hessian" (i.e. second partial derivatives) from the previous section, the Riemannian Hessian transform as:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{H}_{ij} &= \frac{\partial^2 (\L \circ \varphi^{-1})}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} - \tilde\Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial (\L \circ \varphi^{-1})}{\partial \psi^k} \\
      %
      &= \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} + \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} - \left( \Gamma_{mn}^o \frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} + \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} \frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o} \right) \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial \theta^o}{\partial \psi^k} \\
      %
      &= \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} + \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} - \Gamma_{mn}^o \cancel{\frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o}} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \cancel{\frac{\partial \theta^o}{\partial \psi^k}} - \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} \cancel{\frac{\partial \psi^k}{\partial \theta^o}} \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \cancel{\frac{\partial \theta^o}{\partial \psi^k}} \\
      %
      &= \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n} \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} \cancel{+ \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j}} - \Gamma_{mn}^o \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \cancel{- \frac{\partial^2 \theta^o}{\partial \psi^i \partial \psi^j} \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o}} \\
      %
      &= \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \L}{\partial \theta^m \partial \theta^n} - \Gamma_{mn}^o \frac{\partial \L}{\partial \theta^o} \right) \\
      %
      &= \frac{\partial \theta^m}{\partial \psi^i} \frac{\partial \theta^n}{\partial \psi^j} H_{mn} .
\end{align*}
$$

Note that while this transformation rule is very similar to the transformation of the "calculus Hessian" _at a critical point_, the transformation rule of the Riemannian Hessian applies everywhere on $\Theta$.

**This means, seen as a bilinear map, the Hessian is invariant _everywhere_ on $\Theta$**. (Not just at the critical points as before.)
How does this discrepancy happen?
This is because we ignore $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ in calculus!
This is, of course, justified since $\Gamma^k_{ij} \equiv 0$.
But as can be seen in its transformation rule, under a reparametrization $\varphi$, this quantity is non-zero in general in $\psi$ parametrization---this is already true for a simple, common transformation between the Cartesian and polar coordinates.

## The Invariance of the Hessian Eigenvalues, Determinant, and Trace

Let us focus on the determinant of the Hessian.
As discussed above, it is not invariant.
This is true even if the Riemannian Hessian above is used.
How do we make sense of this?

To make sense of this, we need to fully understand the object we care about when we talk about the determinant of the Hessian as a measure of the flatness of the loss landscape of $\L$.

The loss landscape of $\L$ is the _graph_ $\\{ (\theta, \L(\theta)) \in \R^{d+1}: \theta \in \Theta \\}$ of $\L$.
This is actually a $d$-dimensional [hypersurface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface) embedded in $\R^{d+1}$.
In particular, a hypersurface is a manifold.
Meanwhile, the concept of "sharpness" or "flatness" of the loss landscape of $\L$ is nothing but the curvatures of the above manifold, particularly the principal curvatures, Gaussian curvature, and mean curvature.

These curvatures can actually be derived from the Hessian of $\L$ since this Hessian is the second fundamental form of that manifold. (See that previous post!)
However, to obtain those curvatures, we _must_ first derive the **_shape operator_** with the help of the metric. (The shape operator is a linear operator, mapping a vector to a vector.)
Suppose the matrix representation of the metric on $\Theta$ is $\mathbf{G}$.
Then, the shape operator $E$ is given by

$$
  \mathbf{E} := \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{H} .
$$

The principal, Gaussian, and mean curvatures of the loss landscape are then the eigenvalues, determinant, and trace of $\mathbf{E}$, respectively.
The reason why we can simply take eigenvalues or determinant or trace of the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$ in calculus is because, by default, $\mathbf{G}$ is assumed to be the $d \times d$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$, i.e. the Euclidean metric.
That is $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{H}$ and we can ignore the $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ term above.

But notice that under a reparametrization $\varphi: \theta \to \psi$, we have

$$
  \mathbf{G} \mapsto (\mathbf{J}^{-1})^\top \mathbf{G} \mathbf{J}^{-1} .
$$

So, even when $\mathbf{G} \equiv \mathbf{I}$ in the $\theta$ parametrization, the matrix representation of the metric is different than $\mathbf{I}$ in the $\psi$ parametrization!
That is, we _must not_ ignore the metric in the shape operator, however trivial it might be, if we care about reparametrization.
_This is the cause of the non-invariance of the Hessian's eigenvalues, determinant, and trace observed in deep learning!_

First, let us see the transformation of the shape operator by combining the transformation rules of $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{H}$:

$$
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} &= \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^{-1} \tilde{\mathbf{H}} \\
    %
    &= ((\mathbf{J}^{-1})^\top \mathbf{G} \mathbf{J}^{-1})^{-1} (\mathbf{J}^{-1})^\top \mathbf{H} \mathbf{J}^{-1} \\
    %
    &= \mathbf{J} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \cancel{\mathbf{J}^\top} \cancel{\mathbf{J}^{-\top}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{J}^{-1} \\
    %
    &= \mathbf{J} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{J}^{-1} \\
    %
    &= \mathbf{J} \mathbf{E} \mathbf{J}^{-1} .
\end{align}
$$

If we take the determinant of both sides, we have:

$$
  \det \tilde{\mathbf{E}} = \cancel{(\det \mathbf{J})} \cancel{(\det \mathbf{J})^{-1}} (\det \mathbf{E}) = \det \mathbf{E} .
$$

That is, **the determinant of the Hessian, seen as a shape operator, is invariant!**

What about the trace of $\mathbf{E}$?
Recall that $\tr{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}} = \tr{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{A}}$.
Using this property and the transformation of $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ above, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{tr}\, \tilde{\mathbf{E}} &= \tr{\mathbf{J} \mathbf{E} \mathbf{J}^{-1}} = \tr{\mathbf{J} \mathbf{J}^{-1} \mathbf{E}} = \mathrm{tr}\, \mathbf{E} ,
\end{align}
$$

and so **the trace is also invariant**.

Finally, we can also show a general invariance result for eigenvalues.
Recall that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the linear operator $\mathbf{E}$ if $\mathbf{E} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$ for an eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$.

Let $(\lambda, \mathbf{v})$ be an eigenpair on the $\theta$ parametrization and $(\tilde{\lambda}, \tilde{\mathbf{v}})$ be an eigenpair on the $\psi$ parametrization.
We want to show that $\lambda = \tilde{\lambda}$.
Recall vectors are transformed by multiplying it with the Jacobian of $\varphi$.
So, $\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = \mathbf{J} \mathbf{v}$.
Therefore:

$$
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}} \tilde{\mathbf{v}} &= \tilde{\lambda} \tilde{\mathbf{v}} \\
  %
  \mathbf{J} \mathbf{E} \cancel{\mathbf{J}^{-1}} \cancel{\mathbf{J}} \mathbf{v} &= \tilde{\lambda} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{v} \\
  %
  \mathbf{J} \mathbf{E} &= \tilde{\lambda} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{v} \\
  %
  \mathbf{E} &= \tilde{\lambda} \mathbf{v} ,
\end{align}
$$

where the last step is done by multiplying both sides by the inverse of the Jacobian---recall that $\varphi$ is invertible.

Therefore, we identify that $\lambda = \tilde\lambda$.
Since $\lambda$ is an arbitrary eigenvalue, we conclude that **all eigenvalues of $\mathbf{E}$ are invariant**.

## Non-Invariance from the Tensor Analysis Viewpoint

In tensor analysis, this issue is very easy to identify.
First, the Hessian represents a bilinear map, so it is a _covariant 2-tensor_.
Meanwhile, when we talk about eigenvalues, we refer to the [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem) and this theorem applies to _linear maps_.
So, there is a _type mismatch_ here.

To apply the spectral theorem on the Hessian, we need to express it as a linear map.
This can be done by viewing the Hessian as a linear map on the tangent space onto itself, which is a _1-contravariant 1-covariant tensor_.
That is, we need to "raise" one of the indices of $H$.
How do we do this?
You guessed it: Multiply $H$ with the inverse of the metric.

## Conclusion

The reason why "flatness measures" derived from the calculus version of Hessian is not invariant is simply because we measure those "flatness measures" from an incorrect object.
The correct object we should use is the shape operator, which is obtained with the help of the metric (even when the latter is Euclidean).

Moreover, the reason why Newton's method is not invariant (see Sec. 12 of [Martens, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1193)) is that we ignore the second term involving the connection coefficient $\Gamma$.

Ignoring those geometric quantities are totally justified in calculus and deep learning since we always assume a Euclidean metric along with the Cartesian coordinates.
But this simplification makes us "forget" about the correct transformation of the Hessian, giving rise to the pathological non-invariance issues observed in deep learning.
