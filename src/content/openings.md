# Open Positions

I have openings for funded 4-year **PhD** and 5-terms (~1.5 years) thesis-based **MSc** students, to work on **large-scale probabilistic models** (Bayesian and frequentist), **decision-making under uncertainty** (Bayesian optimization, bandits, tree search, etc.), and their applications in **AI4Science** (chemistry, biology, etc.).

## PhD positions

- See if you fulfill the [basic requirements](https://grad.uwo.ca/admissions/programs/program.cfm?p=38) set by the school.
- To be compatible with me, you must both: (i) have **solid foundational mathematical and programming knowledge**, and just as importantly, (ii) **be reliable**.
  - If you are somewhat comfortable reading [Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) or [Murphy's Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) book, then you are on the right track.
  - Reliability means: you are **self-disciplined** and **organized**; if you promised that you are going to do $A$ by time $T$, then you must deliver $A$ at time $T$, with few exceptions.
- Before you apply on the system, contact me via email.
  - Give a short intro on why we will be a good match.
  - Attach your CV and transcripts.
- I will contact you back as soon as I can, and we go from there.

  - If you have taken statistics, probability theory, and analysis (or advanced calculus) classes, and you actually like them, then you are on the right track.
  - Reliability means: you are **self-disciplined** and **organized**; if you promised that you are going to do $A$ by time $T$, then you must deliver $A$ at time $T$, with few exceptions.
