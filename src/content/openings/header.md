## Open Positions

I have a few openings for funded 4-year **PhD** and 5-term (~1.5 years) thesis-based **MSc** students, to work on **large-scale probabilistic models** (Bayesian and frequentist), **decision-making under uncertainty** (Bayesian optimization, bandits, tree search, etc.), and their applications in **AI4Science** (chemistry, biology, etc.).

**Important:** My work is in the **foundation of machine learning** (think math, proofs, algorithms), but motivated by applications. I'm **not** looking for candidates who are interested only in applications.
