- See if you fulfill the [basic requirements](https://csd.uwo.ca/graduate/future/admission.html) set by the school.
- To be compatible with me, you must both: (i) have **solid foundational mathematical and programming knowledge**, and just as importantly, (ii) **be reliable**.
  - If you have taken statistics, probability theory, and analysis (or advanced calculus) classes, and you actually like them, then you are on the right track.
  - Reliability means: you are **self-disciplined** and **organized**; if you promised that you are going to do $A$ by time $T$, then you must deliver $A$ at time $T$, with few exceptions.
- Before you apply on the system, contact me via email.
  - Give a short intro on why we will be a good match.
  - Attach your CV and transcripts.
- If there is a potential match, I will contact you back as soon as I can, and we go from there.

**Note:** Since I have more funding for PhD positions, I will prioritize prospective MSc students who are committed to the ["direct-entry" PhD](https://csd.uwo.ca/graduate/future/admission.html#direct) pathway.
